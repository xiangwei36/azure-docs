# Enumerate Service Fabric Reliable Actors
The Reliable Actors service allows a client to enumerate metadata about the actors that the service is hosting. Because the actor service is a partitioned stateful service, enumeration is performed per partition. Because each partition might contain many actors, the enumeration is returned as a set of paged results. The pages are looped over until all pages are read. The following example shows how to create a list of all active actors in one partition of an actor service:

```csharp
IActorService actorServiceProxy = ActorServiceProxy.Create(
    new Uri("fabric:/MyApp/MyService"), partitionKey);

ContinuationToken continuationToken = null;
List<ActorInformation> activeActors = new List<ActorInformation>();

do
{
    PagedResult<ActorInformation> page = await actorServiceProxy.GetActorsAsync(continuationToken, cancellationToken);

    activeActors.AddRange(page.Items.Where(x => x.IsActive));

    continuationToken = page.ContinuationToken;
}
while (continuationToken != null);
```

```Java
ActorService actorServiceProxy = ActorServiceProxy.create(
    new URI("fabric:/MyApp/MyService"), partitionKey);

ContinuationToken continuationToken = null;
List<ActorInformation> activeActors = new ArrayList<ActorInformation>();

do
{
    PagedResult<ActorInformation> page = actorServiceProxy.getActorsAsync(continuationToken);

    while(ActorInformation x: page.getItems())
    {
         if(x.isActive()){
              activeActors.add(x);
         }
    }

    continuationToken = page.getContinuationToken();
}
while (continuationToken != null);
```
